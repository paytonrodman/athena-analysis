# athena-analysis
A set of analysis scripts for use with Athena++ data files. The scripts contained within are based on [Athena++ v19.0](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena-public-version/releases/tag/v19.0) (archived). Athena++ is a GRMHD and Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) code. The latest release is available at https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena.

## Dependencies

Most core scripts contained here rely on a slightly modified version of Athena++'s `athena_read.py`, contained within the `Dependencies` folder. In addition, you will need:

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (for plotting scripts)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
